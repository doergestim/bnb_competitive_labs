# Weaponizing Active Directory

**Active Directory (AD)** is Microsoft's directory service. It's what most corporate networks use to manage users, computers, permissions, and policies in one place. If you've ever logged into a school or work computer and had access to shared drives and printers automatically, that was AD doing its job.

The problem? When an attacker gets a foothold inside a network, AD becomes their best friend. It's basically a map of everything: who exists, what they can access, and how systems trust each other. Attackers don't just break things - they read the map and walk through the front door.

## What Attackers Are Actually Looking For

Once inside a network, attackers focus on four main things AD exposes:

**Domain Trust Relationships** - companies often link multiple AD domains together so users can move between them. If one domain is compromised, those trust relationships can be a bridge to others.

**Group Policies (GPOs)** - these are settings pushed to machines across the domain. Misconfigured GPOs can allow attackers to run code on other systems or modify security settings silently.

**User and Group Privileges** - AD stores who belongs to what group. Finding a misconfigured privilege (like a regular user having admin rights somewhere they shouldn't) is often how attackers escalate.

**Object Access Control Lists (ACLs)** - every object in AD (users, computers, groups) has an ACL that says who can do what to it. A poorly set ACL can let an attacker reset a Domain Admin's password or take over an account without ever touching a password file.

The goal of all of this recon is to reach **Domain Admin** - full control over the entire domain. From there, the attacker owns every machine, every user, and every resource on the network.

## How Attackers Get There

The typical path looks like this:

- Compromise one low-privilege account (phishing, password spray, leaked creds)
- Run enumeration tools to map out the domain silently
- Find a misconfigured ACL, over-privileged group, or exploitable trust
- Move laterally to a higher-privilege account
- Reach Domain Admin and establish persistence

Tools like BloodHound make this process visual - attackers literally see attack paths laid out as graphs and follow the shortest one.

## How This Gets Detected

Because AD attacks rely heavily on querying directory objects and authenticating to systems, they leave traces:

- **SIEM Log Analysis** - tools like Splunk or Microsoft Sentinel can flag unusual LDAP queries, bulk user enumeration, or suspicious Kerberos ticket requests
- **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)** - if an account that normally logs in from one machine suddenly starts touching fifty others, that's flagged as anomalous
- **Endpoint Security Protection Analysis** - EDR tools catch tools like BloodHound being executed or unusual AD enumeration happening on a host
- **Active Defense and Cyber Deception** - honeypot accounts or fake AD objects (canary tokens) can alert defenders the moment an attacker touches something they shouldn't know exists

- [Easy 2 – Trust Issues](ctfs/WAD_easy-2.md)
- [Medium – ACL Abuse](ctfs/WAD_medium.md)

## Labs

Hands-on practice with the tools used by both attackers and defenders:

- [BloodHound Lab](labs/bloodhound.md)
- [PlumHound Lab](labs/plumhound.md)
- [Adminer Lab](labs/adminer.md)
- [SCCMHunter Lab](labs/sccmhunter.md)

AD attacks are some of the most common techniques seen in real-world breaches. Understanding how attackers map and abuse directory services is just as important for defenders as it is for red teamers. The goal isn't just to know the tools - it's to understand why the misconfigurations exist in the first place.
