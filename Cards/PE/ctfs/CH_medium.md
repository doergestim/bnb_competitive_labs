# Medium CTF - Memory Dump Analysis

Your SIEM triggers an alert on a workstation in the accounting department. The alert reads:

```
[HIGH] Process lsass.exe accessed by non-system process
Source Process: svchost_helper.exe (PID 4872)
User Context: ACCOUNTING\jdoe
Time: 02:14 AM
```

You pull the process list from that machine around the same time:

```
PID   Name                  Parent        User
----  --------------------  ------------  ----------------
4872  svchost_helper.exe    explorer.exe  ACCOUNTING\jdoe
4901  cmd.exe               4872          ACCOUNTING\jdoe
4934  net.exe               4901          ACCOUNTING\jdoe
```

You also notice `net.exe` was used to run:

```
net user administrator /domain
```
