# Easy CTF 2 - Spray the Lab

You are reviewing authentication logs from your SIEM after it triggered a low-priority alert. You notice the following pattern over a 20-minute window:

```
[08:12:04] FAILED  john.smith      Password: Summer2024!
[08:12:06] FAILED  jane.doe        Password: Summer2024!
[08:12:08] FAILED  helpdesk        Password: Summer2024!
[08:12:10] SUCCESS m.torres        Password: Summer2024!
[08:12:12] FAILED  svc.backup      Password: Summer2024!
```

No single account was attempted more than once.

## Question

Why did the attacker use only one password attempt per account instead of trying many passwords on one account?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** They did not know any other passwords to try
- **B)** They were only targeting the `m.torres` account specifically
- **C)** The domain controller was blocking all traffic except from that IP
- **D)** To avoid triggering account lockout policies while still finding weak credentials

---

Correct Flag: **D**
