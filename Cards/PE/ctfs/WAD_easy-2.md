# Easy CTF 2 - Trust Issues

You are reviewing a SIEM alert. The alert was triggered when a user account from **Domain A** authenticated against a resource in **Domain B**. The two domains have a trust relationship configured.

The account in question belongs to a help desk technician in Domain A. It has never accessed Domain B before. The authentication happened at 2:47 AM on a Saturday.

There are no open tickets or change requests for that night.
