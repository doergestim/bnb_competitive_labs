# Easy CTF 1 – Finding SPNs

You have access to a Windows domain as a **low-privileged domain user**.

During basic Active Directory enumeration, you run a command to list Service Principal Names (SPNs) and get the following result:

```
ServicePrincipalName        Name               MemberOf
--------------------------  -----------------  ----------------
MSSQLSvc/db01.lab.local     sqlservice         Domain Users
HTTP/web.lab.local          websvc             Domain Users
```

## Question

Why is this information interesting to an attacker?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** These services are misconfigured and will crash  
- **B)** These accounts can be targeted for Kerberoasting  
- **C)** These services are exposed to the internet  
- **D)** These accounts have expired passwords  

---

Correct Flag: **B**

---

## Explanation

Any domain user can request Kerberos service tickets for accounts that have SPNs.  
Those tickets can be extracted and cracked offline, which is the basis of Kerberoasting.
