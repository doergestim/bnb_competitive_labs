# Hard CTF - Full Network Takeover via DHCPv6

You are a senior analyst responding to an incident. An endpoint detection tool flagged unusual outbound traffic from multiple workstations to an internal IP that isn't in your asset registry. You begin pulling data.

**UEBA alert:**
```
Anomaly detected: 14 workstations authenticating to unknown host 192.168.1.99
Timeframe: 08:45 – 09:10
User accounts involved: 14 distinct domain accounts
```

**DHCPv6 traffic log (08:44):**
```
08:44:12  ff02::1:2  (multicast)   DHCPv6   SOLICIT from fe80::aabb:ccdd
08:44:12  192.168.1.99             DHCPv6   ADVERTISE — DNS server: fe80::aabb:ccdd
08:44:13  <all 14 workstations>    DHCPv6   REQUEST → accepted
```

**DNS query log (08:45 onward):**
```
workstation-01 → fe80::aabb:ccdd  DNS  query: dc01.corp.local
fe80::aabb:ccdd → workstation-01  DNS  response: 192.168.1.99

workstation-02 → fe80::aabb:ccdd  DNS  query: dc01.corp.local  
fe80::aabb:ccdd → workstation-02  DNS  response: 192.168.1.99
[... repeated for all 14 workstations ...]
```

**NetFlow data (08:45 – 09:10):**
```
All 14 workstations → 192.168.1.99   SMB/LDAP   Authentication attempts
192.168.1.99 → dc01.corp.local       LDAP       Forwarded authentication sessions
```

Your environment has no IPv6 infrastructure. There is no legitimate DHCPv6 server on the network.

## Question

Putting the full picture together - what is the correct sequence of events, and what is the attacker's end goal?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** The attacker flooded the network with DHCPv6 packets to cause a denial of service, and the authentication attempts are a side effect of workstations trying to re-establish connectivity
- **B)** The attacker used MITM6 to become the DHCPv6 server, set itself as the DNS resolver, redirected domain controller lookups to its own machine, and relayed the resulting LDAP/SMB authentication sessions to gain domain-level access
- **C)** The attacker compromised the DHCP server and modified existing IPv4 leases to point DNS at a rogue host, then waited for natural lease renewals to redirect traffic
- **D)** The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DNS server to return forged responses, using DHCPv6 as a distraction to prevent defenders from identifying the real attack vector

---

Correct Flag: **B**
