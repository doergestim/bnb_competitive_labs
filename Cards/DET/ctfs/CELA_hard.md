# Hard CTF - Full Cloud Intrusion

You are a SOC analyst. It is Friday afternoon. A Falco alert fires, then another, then your SIEM starts correlating events across three different services. You open the investigation.

Below is what you have — logs pulled from CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and S3 access logs, spanning 90 minutes.

---

### Phase 1 - Initial Access (14:03-14:11)

```
[14:03] GetObject: s3://company-terraform-state/prod.tfstate  
        Principal: AKIA3EXAMPLE7XQZABCD (access key, no MFA)  
        Source IP: 91.108.4.200  

[14:09] ConsoleLogin: FAILED  
        UserName: admin  
        Source IP: 91.108.4.200  

[14:11] ConsoleLogin: SUCCESS  
        UserName: svc-terraform  
        Source IP: 91.108.4.200  
```

The Terraform state file contains plaintext database passwords and internal hostnames. The `svc-terraform` account uses an API key stored in that state file.

---

### Phase 2 - Enumeration & Escalation (14:14-14:38)

```
[14:14] ListInstances, ListSecurityGroups, DescribeVpcs  
[14:19] CreatePolicyVersion -> Action: "iam:*", Resource: "*" applied to svc-terraform  
[14:22] CreateUser: "cloudops-recovery"  
[14:23] AddUserToGroup: cloudops-recovery -> Group: Administrators  
[14:38] CreateAccessKey for cloudops-recovery  
```

---

### Phase 3 - Exfiltration & Persistence (14:41-15:29)

```
[14:41-15:12] GetObject × 4,200 requests  
               Bucket: s3://company-patient-records-eu  
               Principal: cloudops-recovery  
               Total data transferred: ~18 GB  

[15:17] ModifyInstanceAttribute: EC2 i-0abc123  
        -> UserData updated (base64-encoded reverse shell script)  

[15:22] StopInstances + StartInstances: i-0abc123  
        (forces UserData to execute on reboot)  

[15:29] CloudTrail: StopLogging  
        Principal: cloudops-recovery  
```

## Question

You need to write an initial incident summary for your team lead. Four analysts each propose a description. Which one is accurate and complete?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** An attacker brute-forced the admin console account, escalated privileges through a misconfigured security group, and exfiltrated data via an exposed API endpoint. Persistence was established using a Lambda backdoor.

- **B)** The svc-terraform access key, exposed in a public Terraform state file, was used to access the cloud environment. The attacker escalated privileges by modifying an IAM policy, created a backdoor admin account, exfiltrated approximately 18 GB from an S3 bucket, implanted a reverse shell in EC2 user data, and disabled CloudTrail logging to cover their tracks.

- **C)** A disgruntled insider used their existing admin credentials to download company data and disable logging. No privilege escalation was needed since they already had access. The EC2 instance modification was unrelated scheduled maintenance.

- **D)** Automated malware compromised the svc-terraform account through a phishing email, then pivoted laterally across the VPC using stolen Kerberos tickets. The 18 GB transfer was triggered by a ransomware encryption process running on the EC2 instance.

Correct Flag: **B**
