# Easy CTF 1 – Unusual Login Pattern

You are reviewing authentication logs from a Linux web server after a security alert.

You notice the following entries:

```
sshd[2211]: Failed password for admin from 185.22.10.4 port 49822
sshd[2211]: Failed password for admin from 185.22.10.4 port 49822
sshd[2211]: Failed password for admin from 185.22.10.4 port 49822
sshd[2230]: Accepted password for admin from 185.22.10.4 port 49822
```

The server normally only allows internal administrators to log in.
