# Easy CTF 2 – Finding the Canary

A document containing a hidden tracking link (a canary token) was placed on an internal file share.

Later, an alert appears:

```
Token triggered
Source IP: 185.77.12.90
User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
Location: External network
```

No employee should access this token from outside the company.
