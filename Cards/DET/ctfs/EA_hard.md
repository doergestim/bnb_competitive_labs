# Hard CTF - Full Endpoint Compromise

You are handed a Velociraptor hunt report for an endpoint flagged by your SIEM. Your job is to piece together the full attack chain from the evidence below.

**Artifact: Windows.System.Pslist**
```

## Question

You need to write a one-line summary of the full attack chain for your incident report. Which of the following correctly describes the complete sequence of events?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** The attacker exploited lsass.exe directly to gain SYSTEM privileges, then used certutil to download a backdoor and scheduled it to run at startup via a fake Office update task
- **B)** A malicious Word document spawned a command prompt, which used certutil to download a payload, which then dumped credentials from lsass and established persistence via a scheduled task disguised as a Windows update
- **C)** A phishing email delivered a PowerShell script that downloaded malware using certutil, accessed lsass for credentials, then used Word macros to create a scheduled task for persistence
- **D)** The attacker used a stolen SYSTEM token to launch Word, which then downloaded a credential harvester through a scheduled task and connected to a C2 server via certutil

---

Correct Flag: **B**
