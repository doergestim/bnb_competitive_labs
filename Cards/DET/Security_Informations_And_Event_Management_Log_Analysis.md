# Security Informations And Event Management(SIEM) Log Analysis


**Security Information and Event Management** (**SIEM**) is the process of collecting and analyzing logs from many systems in one place so defenders can spot suspicious activity early.

Instead of checking logs on each server separately, a SIEM gathers events from endpoints, servers, firewalls, and applications, then helps analysts identify patterns that may indicate compromise.

Logs on their own are just data. SIEM turns that data into visibility.

## Why SIEM Matters

Attackers rarely do only one thing. They generate many small events across different systems:

- Failed logins
- Strange network traffic
- Unexpected process execution
- Privilege changes
- Access from unusual locations

A SIEM helps connect these events together so analysts can see the bigger picture instead of isolated alerts.

## How Attackers Try to Avoid Detection

Attackers know defenders rely on logs, so they often try to:

- Blend in with normal activity
- Spread actions over time
- Use legitimate tools to avoid obvious malware signatures
- Delete or alter logs when possible
- Generate noise to hide real activity

Good log analysis focuses on behavior, not just individual alerts.

## What Analysts Look For

During SIEM investigations, analysts usually focus on:

- Unusual authentication patterns
- Traffic to unknown or suspicious destinations
- Sudden spikes in activity
- Rare commands or processes
- Events that happen outside normal business hours

The goal is not only to detect attacks, but to understand the timeline of what happened.

## CTF Challenges

You will solve four challenges focused on log analysis and SIEM workflows:

- [Easy 1 – Suspicious Login Pattern](ctfs/siem_easy-1.md)
- [Easy 2 – Basic Log Correlation](ctfs/siem_easy-2.md)
- [Medium – Multi-Source Investigation](ctfs/siem_medium.md)
- [Hard – Stealthy Attack Timeline Reconstruction](ctfs/siem_hard.md)

## Labs

Hands-on practice with SIEM-related tools:

- [Security Onion Lab](labs/security-onion.md)
- [OSSIM Lab](labs/ossim.md)
- [Wazuh Lab](labs/wazuh.md)
- [JPCERT Tool Analysis Lab](labs/jpcert-tool-analysis.md)

SIEM log analysis is less about memorizing alerts and more about understanding behavior across systems. The stronger your investigation process becomes, the faster you can detect and contain real attacks.
