# Canarytokens 

# Any VM

First, we will need to navigate to the canarytokens server from a system with Microsoft Word on it: 

https://www.canarytokens.org/generate#

Search for ```Microsoft Word```

Now, let's create a token Word Document: 

<img width="638" height="430" alt="word_token" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/145c6b7c-4aa2-4a36-8d39-3d431962196d" />
  

Then select Create Token. 

  

When you get the next screen, select Download your MS Word File.  

  

Then, download it and open it.

Notice that it is just an empty Word document. You can add whatever you want in it. 

  

Now, check your email. 

  

You should have gotten an alert:

Now, let's play with the site cloner: 


Search for ```JS cloned website```

<img width="140" height="144" alt="web_clone" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966e4f1d-9e09-4f98-912f-32c5fbed5f89" />
  

Next, fill in the appropriate fields:

Now, select Create my Canarytoken. 

  

Now we will need to copy the JavaScript and put it somewhere so it triggers: 

<img width="572" height="604" alt="web_generated_token" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cadba2ee-abce-4ee7-8a74-6092c6f80034" />


Now, let's test out the JavaScript Canary token. Open a Linux terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
cd ~/ADCD/canaryToken
```

In this directory, we have a HTML file called ```index.html```. In this file, we will write the generated JavaScript token.

Open the HTML file with a text editor and at the very bottom of the file inside the ```<script> </script>``` tags write the generated JavaScript token.

Then, save it and close it.

Now we have a page that has the role of a cloned site. In order to test the functionality of the canary token through this page, we must add a domain to the ```/etc/hosts```.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The domain we will add must be completely different from the domain we gave at the token creation!!
>(e.g. If we gave ```yourorg.com``` as a domain at the token creation, we must give a completely different domain at the new /etc/hosts record like ```clonedsite.com```)

For this purpose, execute the following:

```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 clonedsite.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

<img width="743" height="284" alt="echo_domain" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c5c4bf2-42f5-4412-a1ee-b20cdd67e84a" />


Now everything is ready. Time for action!

First things first, we must run a server in order to be able to access our page.

```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Then open a browser and access the domain you just added in the ```/etc/hosts```. In our case:
```
http://clonedsite.com
```

In a few moments you should get an email alert: 

<img width="565" height="1207" alt="web_token_triggered" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b48928af-8ad7-4da9-a137-1f0f7bab9060" />
