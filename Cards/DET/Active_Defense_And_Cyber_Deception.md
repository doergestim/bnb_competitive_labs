# Active Defense and Cyber Deception

Active defense and cyber deception focus on **guiding attackers into controlled environments** instead of only trying to block them.  
Defenders create systems that look real — servers, files, credentials, or services — and watch how attackers interact with them.

The goal is simple: detect hostile activity early, collect intelligence, and slow down attackers before they reach real assets.

## What This Means in Practice

Traditional defense waits for alerts after something suspicious happens. Active defense changes that approach.

Defenders intentionally place believable traps such as:

- Fake credentials or documents
- Decoy servers and services
- False network paths
- Controlled systems that appear valuable

If someone interacts with these resources, it is usually a strong signal of malicious activity.

## How Attackers End Up Interacting with Deception

Most attackers do not know they are dealing with a decoy. They typically:

- Scan networks or systems looking for targets
- Discover exposed services or credentials
- Attempt access or movement inside the environment
- Trigger monitoring systems without realizing it

Because legitimate users should rarely touch deceptive assets, alerts tend to be high-confidence and easier to investigate.

## Why Organizations Use Cyber Deception

Active defense helps defenders:

- Detect intrusions earlier
- Understand attacker behavior and tools
- Reduce noise from false positives
- Buy time during an active incident
- Protect real systems by diverting attacker attention

The objective is observation and detection — not retaliation.

## Labs

Hands-on labs for the tools shown on this card:

- [CanaryTokens Lab](labs/canarytokens.md)
- [HoneyBadger Lab](labs/HoneyBadger_files/honeybadger.md)
- [ADHD (Active Defense Harbinger Distribution) Lab](labs/adhd.md)
- [MITRE Engage Lab](labs/mitre-engage.md)

Active defense is not about chasing attackers. It is about making them reveal themselves.  
By learning deception techniques, defenders gain visibility where traditional controls often fail.
