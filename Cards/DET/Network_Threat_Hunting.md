# Network Threat Hunting

Network threat hunting is the practice of **actively searching network traffic for signs of malicious behavior** instead of waiting for alerts to fire. It focuses on finding patterns that automated systems might miss - unusual communication, suspicious protocols, or data leaving the environment unexpectedly.

The goal is simple: detect attackers early by understanding how normal traffic looks and spotting what does not belong.

## What Threat Hunters Actually Look For

Most hunts start from one idea: *something feels off*. Analysts form a hypothesis, then test it against network data.

Common indicators include:

- Unexpected outbound connections
- Hosts talking to rare or unknown destinations
- Command-and-control (C2) style traffic
- Large or unusual data transfers
- Internal systems communicating in strange ways
- Traffic at odd times or using uncommon protocols

Instead of chasing alerts, hunters follow patterns and relationships in the data.

## How Attackers Use the Network

Attackers rely on network communication at almost every stage of an intrusion. Even when malware runs silently, it still needs to talk to something.

Typical attacker activity visible in traffic:

- Initial access tools reaching external infrastructure
- Malware checking in to C2 servers
- Credential theft followed by lateral movement
- Data exfiltration disguised as normal traffic
- Use of encrypted channels to hide activity

Because network traffic crosses systems and boundaries, it often reveals activity that endpoints alone miss.

## How Threat Hunting Works in Practice

A typical workflow looks like this:

1. Define a hunting hypothesis (example: “Internal hosts shouldn’t use this protocol.”)
2. Query network logs or packet data
3. Investigate anomalies
4. Validate whether behavior is malicious or normal
5. Document findings and improve detections

Good hunting combines curiosity, context, and repeatable analysis - not guesswork.

## Labs

Hands-on exercises using tools commonly used for network threat hunting:

- [RITA Lab](labs/ritaLab1.md)
- [Security Onion Lab](labs/security-onion.md)
- [AC-Hunter Community Edition Lab](labs/achunter/ac-hunter.md)
- [espy Lab](labs/espy.md)

Threat hunting is not about chasing every anomaly. It is about learning how attackers use networks and developing the ability to spot subtle signals before they become incidents.
