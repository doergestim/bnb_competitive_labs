# Hard CTF - Full Intrusion Timeline

You are conducting a post-incident investigation. An alert fired four days after the initial compromise - meaning you are working backward from limited artifacts. Logs have been partially cleared, but enough remains.

## Question

You need to brief the incident response lead. Which of the following correctly describes the full attack chain based on the evidence?

---

## Flags (Choose One)

- **A)** The attacker brute-forced a VPN account, moved laterally to a domain controller, and deployed ransomware using a built-in admin account
- **B)** The attacker successfully authenticated to the web portal after credential stuffing, uploaded a web shell through the admin panel, created a Domain Admin account, expanded privileges to Enterprise Admin over several days, and was active on an internal workstation by Day 4
- **C)** A legitimate IT automation script created the `itops_automation` account and the Kerberos alert was a false positive caused by a misconfigured service
- **D)** The attacker phished H.Pereira directly, obtained domain credentials, and created the backdoor account from the finance workstation on Day 1

Correct Flag: **B**
