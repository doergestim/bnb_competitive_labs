# Easy CTF 1 - Suspicious Extension

A user reports their browser is behaving strangely. You pull a list of installed Chrome extensions from their machine and find the following entry:

```
Name:        PDF Converter Pro
ID:          mhjfbmdgcfjbbpaeojofohoefgiehjai
Permissions: tabs, cookies, webRequest, webRequestBlocking, storage, <all_urls>
Installed:   via external registry key (not Chrome Web Store)
Last update: 3 days ago
```

The user says they never installed this extension and does not recognize it.
