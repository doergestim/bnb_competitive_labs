# Phishing

**Phishing** is an attack where users are tricked into revealing credentials, clicking malicious links, or opening infected files. It usually arrives by email but can also come through SMS, chat apps, or social media

Unlike technical exploits, phishing targets **people**, not systems. One successful click is often enough to give attackers access to internal networks, cloud accounts, or sensitive data

## How Phishing Attacks Usually Work

Most phishing attacks follow the same pattern:

- The attacker creates a fake message that looks legitimate  
- The victim is pushed to click a link or open a file  
- A fake login page steals credentials, or malware is delivered  
- The attacker logs in as the victim and moves inside the organization  

Common lures include:

- Password reset warnings  
- Delivery or invoice notifications  
- HR or IT messages  
- Cloud service login requests

## Why Phishing Is So Effective

Phishing works because it:

- Exploits trust in familiar brands and coworkers  
- Creates urgency or fear to trigger fast decisions  
- Bypasses many technical protections by using valid credentials  
- Requires no software vulnerability to succeed  

One exposed account can lead to data theft, ransomware, or full network compromise

## How Phishing Is Detected

Phishing activity is usually detected through:

- SIEM log analysis  
- Email gateway alerts  
- Cloud authentication logs  
- UEBA detecting abnormal user behavior  
- Server and proxy traffic analysis  

Detection often happens **after** the attacker already logged in

## Labs

Hands-on labs using real phishing tools:

- [Modlishka Lab](labs/modlishka.md)  
- [Evilginx Lab](labs/evilginx.md)  
- [Gophish Lab](labs/gophish.md)  
- [Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) Lab](labs/set.md)

Phishing remains the most common initial access vector in real-world intrusions

Understanding how it works and how to detect it is critical for both defenders and investigators
