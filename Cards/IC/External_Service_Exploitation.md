# External Service Exploitation

**External service exploitation** happens when an **attacker** gains access to a system by abusing a service that is exposed to the internet
These services are not websites only - they include **VPNs**, **SSH**, **RDP**, **APIs**, **admin panels**, **mail servers**, and any **application** listening on a public port

If the service is **misconfigured**, **outdated**, or **unpatched**, it becomes an easy entry point.

This is one of the most common real-world attack paths

## How Attackers Reach These Services

Attackers don’t usually target one company directly. They scan the internet at scale.

The usual flow looks like this:

- Scan public IP ranges for open ports
- Identify running services and versions
- Match them against known vulnerabilities
- Exploit the service using public tools
- Gain access to the system
- Move deeper into the environment

Search engines like Shodan make this even easier by indexing exposed services automatically.

---

## Common Causes of Exploitation

Most successful attacks come from simple issues:

- Services exposed that shouldn’t be public
- Old software with known vulnerabilities
- Default or weak credentials
- Missing authentication on APIs or admin panels
- Poor network segmentation

In many cases, no “advanced hacking” is needed - just a known exploit and bad hygiene.

## What Happens After Access Is Gained

Once a service is exploited, attackers often:

- Get a shell or remote access
- Escalate privileges on the system
- Steal credentials and configuration files
- Pivot to internal systems
- Establish persistence

An exploited external service often becomes the **initial foothold** for a full breach.

---

## How This Is Detected

These attacks are usually detected through:

- **Firewall logs** showing unusual inbound connections
- **Server logs** with suspicious requests or crashes
- **SIEM alerts** from correlated events
- Signs of **exploitation attempts** or **successful logins**

Detection often happens late, after access is already established

## CTF Challenges

You will complete four challenges focused on external service exploitation:

- [Easy 1 – Exposed Service](ctfs/ESE_easy-1.md)
- [Easy 2 – Known Vulnerability Abuse](ctfs/ESE_easy-2.md)
- [Medium – Initial Foothold](ctfs/ESE_medium.md)
- [Hard – Internet to Internal Pivot](ctfs/ESE_hard.md)

## Labs

Hands-on labs using common attacker tools:

- [Nuclei Lab](labs/nuclei.md)
- [Metasploit Lab](labs/metasploit.md)
- [Exploit-DB Lab](labs/exploit-db.md)
- [Shodan Lab](labs/shodan.md)

External service exploitation is rarely loud or complex.  
Most breaches start because something was exposed, outdated, or forgotten.  
Learning how attackers find and abuse these services is key to defending real environments.
