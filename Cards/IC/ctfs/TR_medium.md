# Medium CTF - Partner Pivot Scenario

A trusted partner has VPN access to a restricted network segment.

You notice the following timeline:

```
09:02  partner_vpn_connected
09:06  internal_scan_detected 10.0.12.0/24
09:09  SMB_login_attempts multiple_hosts
09:11  data_transfer outbound
```

The partner normally accesses only one application server.
