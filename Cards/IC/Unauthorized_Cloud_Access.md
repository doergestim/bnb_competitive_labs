# Unauthorized Cloud Access

**Unauthorized cloud access** happens when an attacker gains access to
cloud infrastructure or SaaS platforms without permission. This could be
access to cloud servers, storage, identities, or business applications
like email and file sharing.

Because cloud platforms are exposed to the internet and heavily rely on
identity and permissions, a single mistake can give attackers wide
access very quickly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How Cloud Environments Usually Get Compromised

Most cloud attacks follow a familiar pattern:

-   The attacker steals or guesses valid credentials
-   Uses those credentials to log in normally
-   Abuses excessive permissions
-   Expands access across the cloud environment
-   Hides activity in logs or creates persistence

The most common causes are:

-   Phishing and credential theft
-   Weak or missing multi-factor authentication (MFA)
-   Leaked API keys and access tokens
-   Overly permissive IAM roles
-   Misconfigured cloud services and storage

In many cases, no malware is needed---everything is done using
legitimate cloud features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What Attackers Do After Gaining Cloud Access

Once inside the cloud environment, attackers may:

-   Steal data from cloud storage and SaaS apps
-   Create new users or API keys for persistence
-   Disable security controls and logging
-   Deploy malicious virtual machines
-   Pivot into on-prem or other cloud resources

Because cloud access often equals administrative control, the impact can
be immediate and severe.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How Unauthorized Cloud Access Is Detected

Detection usually relies on visibility into identity, logs, and
behavior:

-   SIEM log analysis
-   Cloud audit and event logs
-   Permissions and IAM reviews
-   User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

Suspicious logins, abnormal API usage, and sudden permission changes are
common early warning signs.

## CTF Challenges

You will solve four challenges based on real cloud attack scenarios:

-   [Easy 1 -- Suspicious Cloud Login](ctfs/UCA_easy-1.md)
-   [Easy 2 -- Exposed API Key](ctfs/UCA_easy-2.md)
-   [Medium -- Privilege Escalation in the Cloud](ctfs/UCA_medium.md)
-   [Hard -- Full Cloud Environment Takeover](ctfs/UCA_hard.md)

## Labs

Hands-on labs using real cloud attack and investigation tools:

-   [GraphRunner Lab](labs/graphrunner.md)
-   [ROADtools Lab](labs/roadtools.md)
-   [ScoutSuite Lab](labs/scoutsuite.md)
-   [Pacu Lab](labs/pacu.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unauthorized cloud access is one of the fastest ways attackers take
control of modern organizations. Understanding how it happens and how to
spot it is a core defensive skill for anyone working with cloud systems.
